<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. My research focus on the hydroclimate system, including climate change impacts, detection and attribution. 

I got my Ph.D. degree in Atmospheric Science from University of California, Davis, where I worked on hydroclimate prediction and projection with deep learning models.

- [Higher-order Internal Modes of Variability Imprinted in Observed Year-to-year California Streamflow Changes](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JD040535) **Shiheng Duan**, Giuliana Pallotta, C√©line Bonfils
  - Higher-order EOF modes are derived from the well-known climate variability domains. 
  - The BCSD-CMIP6-LSTM streamflow projections are quantitatively related with internal variability indices using various ML models. 
  - All the models show PNA-5 is the most dominant pattern affecting streamflow in California, which looks like an atmospheric-river pattern. 
  - BCSD does not change variability, as a technical note. 

- [Meteorological Drivers of North American Monsoon Extreme Precipitation Events](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JD040535) 
**Shiheng Duan**, Paul Ullrich, William Boos
  - North American Monsoon area is delineated from a gridded precpitation dataset, and further divded into seven subregions with distinct precipitation characteristics. 
  - The meteorological drivers are identified for extreme precpitation events (p95) for each subregion. 
  - The interaction effects of these meteorological drivers on EPE probability are analyzed.

- [Using Temporal Deep Learning Models to Estimate Daily Snow Water Equivalent Over the Rocky Mountains](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023WR035009)
**Shiheng Duan**, Paul Ullrich, Mark Risser, Alan Rhoades
  - LSTM, TCNN and Transformer models are benchmarked with in-situ snow observations. 
  - A transformation (SWE to SWE ratio) is applied to extrapolate the DL models to generate gridded SWE estimations. 
  - This technique can be used for climate projections (deleted after peer-review). 

- [Using Convolutional Neural Networks for Streamflow Projection in California](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/water/articles/10.3389/frwa.2020.00028/full) **Shiheng Duan**, Paul Ullrich, Lele Shu
  - TCNN can be used for hydrological modelling, in addition to LSTM. 
  - An idealized test is designed for projection purpose. 
  - A "nonlinear" relationship of precipitation-runoff is revealed from DL models for snow-dominant basins.
